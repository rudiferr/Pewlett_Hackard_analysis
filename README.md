# "Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis" Week 7 Challenge
## Overview of the Pewlett Hackard Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to query two questions: who and what positions will soon be retiring and be a part of the "silver tsunami", and which employees are eligible to participate in a mentorship program? Relevant information was included in each table - such as a end date and position titles - along with personal information. This will allow us to fill in senior positions before those employees retire by providing junior employees enxperiences and professional knowledge to be promoted and fill in those gaps.

## Results
### The "Silver Tsunami"
1.) Almost a third of the retirees are Senior Engineers, while another third includes rest of the Senior Staff.
2.) Senior positions have the greatest priority when it comes to deciding which roles the company would need to fill with tenured employees or qualified new hires.
3.) A third of the remaining retirees will also be important to fulfill as the bottom-line will lose numbers higher than indicated as employees retire and progress up the professional ladder into senior positions.
### The Mentorship Program
1.) Among those retiring, 1,549 employees qualify to be a part of the mentorship program.
2.) There are vastly more people retiring than there are potential mentors for the program.
3.) Pewlett-Hackard need to create an knowledge efficient and time aware program that can address this population disparity available mentors prospecteed retirees.

## Summary
To prepare for the eventual impact of the "silver tsunami", we can create a graph that charts prospected retiring dates by year (assuming the retirment age is 65 and they would retire by the end of the calendar year). This gives the company a gauge on how many employees they need to hire to match those that would be retiring. Though, if we then look at the potential mentors we do not have enough retirees to mentor the next generation of employees. Pewlett-Hackard will need to prioritize how many younger employees need to be trained to fill up the retired positions in a time aware manner to prevent any gaps in the company. It would also be beneficial if we created a query that grouped mentor-eligible employees into position titles. This information can help PH plan the mentorship program, specifically, how many mentees a mentor might need to take on to fulfill the retired roles.
